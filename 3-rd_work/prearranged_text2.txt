Going through the forest is mmmmmmmmmmmmmy favourite part of the walk. Benji loves it too. There are rabbits to run 
after and old leaves to smell. Benji’s my dog, by the way, and I’m Grace. I live on a farm with my 
parents and take Benji for a walk most days aftttttttter school.

WWWWWWWWWWhile BBBBenji runs ahead, I stop and taaaaaaaaaaake a phoooooooto of a butteeeeeeeerfly. A nnnnnnnnew Facebook photo? 
Maybe, but my friends already call me 'Nature Girl', so perhaps not. Suddenly, I hear Benji’s bark. 
I look up and see Benji jumping and running round a boy. The boy’s about my age and looks worried. 
'Benji, stop! Come here!' I call and reeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaach into my pocket for his ballllllllllll. 
I’m about to apologise to the boy, but he’s gone, disappeared between the trees.
