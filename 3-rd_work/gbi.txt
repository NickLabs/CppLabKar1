Going through the forest is {m,13}y favourite part of the walk. Benji loves it too. There are rabbits to run 
after and old leaves to smell. Benji’s my dog, by the way, and I’m Grace. I live on a farm with my 
parents and take Benji for a walk most days af{t,8}er school.

{W,10}hile {B,4}enji runs ahead, I stop and t{a,11}ke a ph{o,7}to of a butt{e,8}rfly. A {n,8}ew Facebook photo? 
Maybe, but my friends already call me 'Nature Girl', so perhaps not. Suddenly, I hear Benji’s bark. 
I look up and see Benji jumping and running round a boy. The boy’s about my age and looks worried. 
'Benji, stop! Come here!' I call and r{e,7}{a,10}ch into my pocket for his ba{l,12}. 
I’m about to apologise to the boy, but he’s gone, disappeared between the trees.
