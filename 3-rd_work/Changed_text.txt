But for me to rap lik{e,7} {a,7} computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I h{a,6}lf-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap
Packing a Mac in t{y,7}{t,7}he back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac
The exact same time I attempt these lyrical {a,6}crobat stunts while I'm practicing
That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was si{d,7}gned to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
