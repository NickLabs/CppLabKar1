O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy p{o,4}wer
Dost hold Time's fickle gla{s,2}, his sickle, hour;
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
Thy lovers withering as thy sw{e,2}t self grow'st;
If Nature, sovereign mistre{s,2} over wrack,
As thou goest onwards, sti{l,2} wi{l,2} pluck th{e,2} back,
She k{e,2}ps th{e,2} to this purpose, that her ski{l,2}
May time disgrace and wretched minutes ki{l,2}.
Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
She may detain, but not sti{l,2} k{e,2}p, her treasure:
Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,
And her quietus is to render th{e,2}.
