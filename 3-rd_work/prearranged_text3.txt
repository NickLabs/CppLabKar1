I'''''''’m oooooooout wiuuuuuuuuuuuuuuth Benji again. It’s cold and rainy today, so we’re going fast. As I’m coming through the forest, it starts raining hard, so I run. Suddenly, I’m slipping and falling and, before I know it, I’m lying on my back. Ouch! That hurt. 
Then there’s someone there and a voice aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasays,
'Are you all right? That was a bad fall.' I look up and seessssssssssssssssss the boy from yesterday.
'I’m OK, I think,' I say slowly and the boy helps me up. Benji arrives and theeeeeeeeeeeeeeee boy pats his head. 
'I haven’t seen you at school. Do you live near here?' I ask.
'No, I’m from Manchester,' he says. 'Listen! I have to go. Areeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee you OK to walk home? Do you need help?'
'No, I’m fine. Thanks!' I say, as the boy walks awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
'Hey, I’m Grace. What’s your name?' I call, but he’s already gone.
